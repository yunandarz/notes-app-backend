# notes-app-backend
This repository is the result of my learning from the dicoding platform. In this repository I built a RESTful API for a simple notes application from the backend side. The HTTP server is use the framework of Hapi.

There are 4 criteria in making this project, namely:

1. The web server can save the notes
   
2. The web server can display the notes
   
3. The web server can change the notes
   
4. The web server can delete the notes
